# JARVIS — Regression Checkpoint

> The reference point for the next regression checkpoint. Compare future runs
> against this baseline: the test-suite result should stay green, and any
> script whose verdict *improves* (Blocked → Runnable) means its primitives
> have landed and it can be promoted to a real acceptance test.

**Checkpoint date:** 2026-07-11 (fresh full-suite run)
**Tip commit at capture:** `3dfefa7` on `main` (after Slice 11 — email compose + send)
**Scope:** full suite (deterministic + live/model + live-email) + the four-script
status table below, each script's verdict backed by a documented live run.

> Previous checkpoint (2026-07-09, `a4aa50b`, after slice 5): 193 passed,
> 0 failed, 0 skipped in 175.07s.

## 1. Regression signal — test suite

```
python -m pytest tests/ -q
364 passed, 3 warnings in 313.53s (0:05:13)   # exit 0
```

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Passed | **364** |
| Failed | **0** |
| Skipped | **0** |
| Duration | **313.53s** (5:13) |
| Exit code | **0** |

**0 skipped is significant:** the gated live tests ran and passed too — real
Gemini tool-calling, the vision fallback, live chains against real apps, AND
the two live Gmail sends (`test_email_live.py`, which requires
`TEST_SELF_EMAIL` in `.env` + the OAuth token and emails the user's own
address only). (3 warnings are benign third-party deprecations:
`python_multipart`, `aifc`, `audioop`.)

## 2. Four-script status (spec §1.6) — current verdicts

| # | Script | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Open Spotify → play Discover Weekly | ✅ **Passing** | Live cold run at 12 rounds (slice 6, round-12 update below); playback mechanically verified (Pause control + now-playing). Caveat: a similarly-named user playlist exists; UIA can't distinguish which exact-match the resolver picked. |
| 2 | Close every browser tab except YouTube | ✅ **Passing** | Live 4-tab isolated Chrome run (slice 8 update below); only the YouTube tab survived, batch CONFIRM named count/kept/samples. |
| 3 | Find yesterday's invoice PDF → email Sam | ✅ **Passing** | Live E2E `test_email_live.py::test_live_script3_invoice_chain` (slice 11 update below); Gmail accepted the message, modal showed verbatim recipient + exact attachment path. Runs in every full suite. |
| 4 | Turn brightness down + DND for a film | ⚠ **Partial — NOT passing** | Volume ✅ (readback-verified) and media keys ✅. Brightness fails **honestly**: this monitor exposes no DDC/CI control (hardware, not code — `sbc.set` silently no-ops, so success requires a readback). **DND/Focus Assist does not exist** — deferred, no clean Windows API; it needs its own slice before this script can pass. |

**History — how each verdict was reached** (kept verbatim; the table above is
the current state):

> **Slice-5 baseline (2026-07-09):** script #1 was ⚠ partially runnable
> (primitives existed; Spotify's UI exposure and install status unverified),
> scripts #2–#4 ⛔ blocked on missing verbs (tabs, file-search+email,
> system_control).

> **Slice-6 update (2026-07-10, live acceptance runs):** script #1 was driven
> live 3× through the real pipeline after the multi-step chain loop landed.
> **Chain machinery: proven** — visible plan, per-step HUD counter, a
> mid-chain CONFIRM ("Press enter (submit)") that paused and resumed the
> chain, failure → re-observe → visible replan (revision 2), honest bounded
> exhaustion reports. **Music played in run 1** (Spotify title showed the
> track), but the playlist identity was unverifiable from the UI and every
> full run **exhausted `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS=8`** — the script genuinely needs
> ~10–12 rounds (plan+launch+observe+search-click+type+enter+observe+
> playlist-click+play+verify). Verdict: **blocked on the round budget**, not
> on primitives. Two real primitive bugs found & fixed by these runs:
> Spotify registers no App Paths key (added Start Menu .lnk resolution) and
> retitles its window to the playing track (added owning-process presence to
> the launch verify). Spotify's UI is fully UIA-visible — the vision-fallback
> concern above did not materialize.

> **Round-12 update (2026-07-10, later):** MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS raised 8 → 12 and
> the retitle bug fixed at its second site (`find_window_title` now also
> matches by owning process, so `window="Spotify"` keeps working after the
> title becomes the track name). With those plus a focus-first hint on
> type_text and verify-before-claiming prompt guidance, **script #1 PASSED
> cold, end-to-end**: plan(4 steps) → launch → click Search → type → Enter
> (CONFIRM gated, approved) → observe → click "Discover Weekly playlist
> icon" → click "Play button" → done in 11/12 rounds; playback mechanically
> verified (Pause control + now-playing) with the Discover Weekly page open.
> Script #1 verdict: ✅ **passing** (caveat: a similarly-named user playlist
> exists; UIA can't distinguish which exact-match the resolver picked).

> **Slice-8 update (2026-07-10): scripts #2 and #4 run live.**
> - **Script #2 (close every tab except YouTube): ✅ passing.** New
>   `list_tabs`/`close_tabs` primitives (UIA on the running browser's tab
>   strip; CONFIRM gates ONCE per batch with the resolved count/kept/sample
>   titles in the modal). Live: 4-tab isolated Chrome → modal named
>   "Close 3 tab(s)… keeping 1 (JTab YouTube Film)" → approved → only the
>   YouTube tab survived (VERIFY: 4 before, 1 remain).
> - **Script #4 (volume/brightness/DND for a film): ⚠ partial by hardware &
>   scope.** `set_volume 20` ✅ (readback-verified); `set_brightness` fails
>   HONESTLY on this monitor (no laptop panel, DDC/CI unresponsive —
>   sbc.set silently no-ops, so success now REQUIRES a readback; the live
>   run's false "OK" was caught and fixed). DND/Focus Assist deliberately
>   out of scope (no clean Windows API). Media keys shipped
>   (play_pause/next/prev/stop).
> - **Script #3 (find invoice → email Sam): ⚠ half-unblocked.**
>   `search_files` (AUTO, caged, name/ext/age filters) shipped; the email
>   verb remains the blocker.

> **Slice-11 update (2026-07-11): script #3 run live — ✅ passing.**
> `send_email` shipped (Gmail API, `gmail.send` scope only, OAuth token
> DPAPI-encrypted; CONFIRM on the VERBATIM To/Subject/exact-attachment-path/
> full-body block — no model summary; attachments caged to
> `data/agent_files/`; kill switch `email.enabled`). Live E2E
> (`tests/test_email_live.py::test_live_script3_invoice_chain`): the real
> model found a yesterday-dated invoice PDF via `search_files`, the modal's
> block named the recipient and the exact resolved attachment path, the
> auto-approver verified the To: line before approving (live tests send ONLY
> to `TEST_SELF_EMAIL`), and Gmail ACCEPTED the message (id returned;
> "accepted", never "delivered" — send-only scope can't verify delivery).
> Chain ended `done`. Suite at this checkpoint: **364 passed, 0 failed,
> 0 skipped.**

**Regression coverage note:** script #3 is the only one wired into the suite
as a live acceptance test (`test_email_live.py`). Scripts #1 and #2 were
verified by documented live runs, not by tests that re-run every suite —
their guardrail is the deterministic tests over their primitives
(tabs/apps/input/chain). A regression in #1/#2 end-to-end behavior would NOT
turn the suite red; re-drive them live when their primitives change.

---

## 3. Known gaps carried forward

- **Script #4 is the only spec script not passing.** Remaining blockers:
  **DND/Focus Assist** (verb doesn't exist — no clean public Windows API,
  needs its own deliberately-designed slice) and **brightness on this
  monitor** (hardware: no DDC/CI response; the code's honest failure is
  correct behavior, and no software slice can fix the panel).
- **Email limits (slice 11, documented + test-pinned):** "accepted by
  server" is the strongest verifiable claim; the verbatim modal is the only
  control over a prompt-injected composition; Google test-mode OAuth tokens
  expire after 7 days unless the app is published to production; send-only,
  one recipient, one caged attachment.
- **run_shell denylist is a backstop, not a boundary** (obfuscation-tested);
  vision can confabulate (gate + `from_point` are the defense); memory
  retrieval is lexical.

## 4. How to reproduce this checkpoint

```powershell
cd e:\J.A.R.V.I.S
python -m pytest tests/ -q   # expect: 364 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (~5:15)
                             # needs: a real desktop, GEMINI_API_KEY,
                             # TEST_SELF_EMAIL + data/email OAuth token
                             # (sends 2 live emails to your own address),
                             # and it launches/kills Notepad + a throwaway Chrome
```

The four-script table in §2 is backed by the documented live runs quoted
below it. Re-verify a script by re-driving it live (script #3 re-runs
automatically inside the suite); promote #4 only when a DND slice lands and
a live run passes.
